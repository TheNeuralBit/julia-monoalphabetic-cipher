        "as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish\r\n",
        "for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,\r\n",
        "and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the\r\n",

        "coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back\r\n",
        "to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in\r\n",
        "combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose\r\n",
        "otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals\r\n",

        "falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested\r\n",
        "them and brought them to a stand, with a wary \"Wo-ho! so-ho-then!\" the\r\n",

        "There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its\r\n",
        "forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding\r\n",
        "none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the\r\n",
        "air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the\r\n",
        "waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out\r\n",
        "everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,\r\n",
        "and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed\r\n",

        "ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from\r\n",
        "anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was\r\n",
        "hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from\r\n",

        "once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at\r\n",
        "the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which\r\n",
        "the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing\r\n",
        "footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed\r\n",
        "themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the\r\n",
        "wine-shop.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,\" explained Monsieur\r\n",

        "The three glided by, and went silently down.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of\r\n",
        "the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.\r\n",
        "Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?\"\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"I choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the\r\n",
        "sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another\r\n",
        "thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in\r\n",
        "through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck\r\n",
        "twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to\r\n",
        "make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it,\r\n",
        "three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned\r\n",
        "it as heavily as he could.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the\r\n",
        "room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more\r\n",
        "than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry\r\n",
        "got his arm securely round the daughter's waist, and held her; for he\r\n",
        "felt that she was sinking.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"A-a-a-business, business!\" he urged, with a moisture that was not of\r\n",

        "their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his\r\n",
        "shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her\r\n",
        "down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,\r\n",
        "took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did,\r\n",
        "methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he\r\n",
        "could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to\r\n",
        "where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim\r\n",
        "and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the\r\n",
        "roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from\r\n",
        "the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any\r\n",
        "other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this\r\n",
        "door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.\r\n",
        "Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it\r\n",
        "was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit\r\n",
        "alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work\r\n",
        "requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being\r\n",
        "done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face\r\n",
        "towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at\r\n",
        "him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very\r\n",

        "\"Good day!\" said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that\r\n",
        "bent low over the shoemaking.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"Good day!\"\r\n",

        "\"You are still hard at work, I see?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the\r\n",
        "voice replied, \"Yes--I am working.\" This time, a pair of haggard eyes\r\n",
        "had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the\r\n",
        "faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no\r\n",
        "doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was\r\n",
        "the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo\r\n",
        "of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and\r\n",
        "resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once\r\n",
        "beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and\r\n",
        "suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive\r\n",
        "it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,\r\n",
        "wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered\r\n",
        "home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked\r\n",
        "up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical\r\n",
        "perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were\r\n",
        "aware of had stood, was not yet empty.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I want,\" said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker,\r\n",
        "\"to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening,\r\n",
        "at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the\r\n",
        "other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that\r\n",
        "angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and\r\n",
        "showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his\r\n",
        "labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his\r\n",
        "feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very\r\n",
        "long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and\r\n",
        "thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet\r\n",
        "dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really\r\n",
        "otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.\r\n",
        "His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body\r\n",
        "to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose\r\n",
        "stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion\r\n",
        "from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of\r\n",
        "parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones\r\n",
        "of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,\r\n",
        "pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without\r\n",
        "first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had\r\n",
        "lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without\r\n",
        "first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?\" asked Defarge,\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When\r\n",
        "he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker\r\n",
        "looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the\r\n",
        "unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at\r\n",
        "it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then\r\n",
        "the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The\r\n",
        "look and the action had occupied but an instant.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"You have a visitor, you see,\" said Monsieur Defarge.\r\n",

        "work.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Come!\" said Defarge. \"Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when\r\n",
        "he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker's name.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "information?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"It is a lady's shoe. It is a young lady's walking-shoe. It is in the\r\n",
        "present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.\" He\r\n",
        "glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"And the maker's name?\" said Defarge.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand\r\n",
        "in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the\r\n",
        "hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and\r\n",
        "so on in regular changes, without a moment's intermission. The task of\r\n",
        "recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he\r\n",
        "had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or\r\n",
        "endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a\r\n",
        "fast-dying man.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work\r\n",
        "again, until the silence was again broken.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his\r\n",
        "hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face\r\n",
        "from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and\r\n",
        "resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a\r\n",

        "intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves\r\n",
        "through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on\r\n",

        "over his labour.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument\r\n",
        "in his hand, for his shoemaker's knife. It lay on that side of him\r\n",
        "which was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was\r\n",
        "stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He\r\n",
        "raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward,\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began\r\n",
        "to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed\r\n",

        "little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action\r\n",

        "in both his own.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly\r\n",
        "brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned\r\n",
        "against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word \"To the Barrier!\" The\r\n",

        "dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,\r\n",

        "proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,\r\n",
        "proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence\r\n",
        "in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if\r\n",
        "it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was\r\n",
        "no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more\r\n",
        "convenient places of business. Tellson's (they said) wanted\r\n",
        "no elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no\r\n",

        "Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the\r\n",

        "suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly\r\n",
        "objectionable, but were only the more respectable.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden\r\n",
        "drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when\r\n",
        "they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they\r\n",

        "made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their\r\n",
        "parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family\r\n",
        "papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great\r\n",

        "brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud,\r\n",
        "ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in\r\n",
        "the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine\r\n",
        "Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;\r\n",
        "secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with\r\n",
        "them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and\r\n",
        "generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have\r\n",
        "his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the\r\n",
        "Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be\r\n",

        "the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that\r\n",

        "north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers\r\n",
        "grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a\r\n",
        "consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom,\r\n",
        "instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a\r\n",
        "settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which\r\n",
        "the peaches ripened in their season.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part\r\n",
        "of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,\r\n",
        "though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a\r\n",
        "glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful\r\n",
        "place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and\r\n",
        "there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where\r\n",
        "several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was\r\n",
        "audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In\r\n",
        "a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree\r\n",
        "rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver\r\n",
        "to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant\r\n",
        "who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if\r\n",
        "he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all\r\n",
        "visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured\r\n",
        "to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have\r\n",
        "a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray\r\n",
        "workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered\r\n",
        "about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a\r\n",
        "thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions\r\n",

        "the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking\r\n",
        "up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to\r\n",
        "know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in\r\n",
        "his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up\r\n",
        "and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says\r\n",
        "a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it\r\n",
        "best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down\r\n",

        "with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and\r\n",

        "as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she\r\n",
        "had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant\r\n",
        "sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against\r\n",
        "her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do\r\n",
        "playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own\r\n",
        "chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at\r\n",
        "them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with\r\n",
        "eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would\r\n",
        "have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,\r\n",
        "beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor\r\n",
        "stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no\r\n",
        "Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain\r\n",
        "for the fulfilment of Miss Pross's prediction.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of\r\n",
        "the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and\r\n",
        "always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest\r\n",
        "quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their\r\n",
        "contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be\r\n",
        "better. Miss Pross's friendship being of the thoroughly practical\r\n",
        "kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of\r\n",
        "impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would\r\n",
        "impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters\r\n",
        "of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl\r\n",
        "who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress,\r\n",
        "or Cinderella's Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,\r\n",
        "a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she\r\n",
        "pleased.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table, but on other days\r\n",
        "persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower\r\n",
        "regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to\r\n",
        "which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion,\r\n",
        "Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird's pleasant face and pleasant efforts\r\n",
        "to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the\r\n",
        "wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit\r\n",
        "there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,\r\n",
        "they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for\r\n",
        "the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some\r\n",
        "time before, as Mr. Lorry's cup-bearer; and while they sat under the\r\n",
        "plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs\r\n",
        "and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree\r\n",
        "whispered to them in its own way above their heads.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay\r\n",
        "presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he\r\n",
        "was only One.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross\r\n",
        "suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and\r\n",
        "retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this\r\n",
        "disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, \"a fit of the\r\n",
        "jerks.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The\r\n",
        "resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as\r\n",
        "they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting\r\n",
        "his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the\r\n",
        "likeness.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual\r\n",
        "vivacity. \"Pray, Doctor Manette,\" said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the\r\n",
        "plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,\r\n",
        "which happened to be the old buildings of London--\"have you seen much of\r\n",
        "the Tower?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of\r\n",
        "it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"_I_ have been there, as you remember,\" said Darnay, with a smile,\r\n",
        "though reddening a little angrily, \"in another character, and not in a\r\n",
        "character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a\r\n",
        "curious thing when I was there.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"What was that?\" Lucie asked.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which\r\n",
        "had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of\r\n",
        "its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by\r\n",
        "prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone\r\n",
        "in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to\r\n",
        "execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with\r\n",
        "some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.\r\n",
        "At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully\r\n",
        "examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or\r\n",
        "legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses\r\n",
        "were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested\r\n",
        "that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The\r\n",
        "floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the\r\n",
        "earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found\r\n",
        "the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case\r\n",
        "or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he\r\n",
        "had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"My father,\" exclaimed Lucie, \"you are ill!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and\r\n",
        "his look quite terrified them all.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they\r\n",
        "made me start. We had better go in.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large\r\n",
        "drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. But, he\r\n",
        "said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told\r\n",
        "of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry\r\n",
        "either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned\r\n",
        "towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it\r\n",
        "when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of\r\n",
        "his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more\r\n",
        "steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he\r\n",
        "was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and\r\n",
        "that the rain had startled him.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon\r\n",
        "her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he\r\n",
        "made only Two.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and\r\n",
        "windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was\r\n",
        "done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the\r\n",
        "heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton\r\n",
        "leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of\r\n",
        "the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the\r\n",
        "ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,\" said Doctor\r\n",

        "\"It comes surely,\" said Carton.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a\r\n",
        "dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to\r\n",
        "get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes\r\n",
        "resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a\r\n",
        "footstep was there.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!\" said Darnay, when they had\r\n",
        "listened for a while.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?\" asked Lucie. \"Sometimes, I have\r\n",
        "sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of\r\n",
        "a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and\r\n",
        "solemn--\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Let us shudder too. We may know what it is.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we\r\n",
        "originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have\r\n",
        "sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,\"\r\n",
        "Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more\r\n",
        "rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,\r\n",
        "as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some\r\n",
        "coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in\r\n",
        "the distant streets, and not one within sight.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or\r\n",
        "are we to divide them among us?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you\r\n",
        "asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and\r\n",
        "then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come\r\n",
        "into my life, and my father's.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I take them into mine!\" said Carton. \"_I_ ask no questions and make no\r\n",

        "and I see them--by the Lightning.\" He added the last words, after there\r\n",
        "had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"And I hear them!\" he added again, after a peal of thunder. \"Here they\r\n",
        "come, fast, fierce, and furious!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,\r\n",
        "for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and\r\n",
        "lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment's\r\n",
        "interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at\r\n",

        "forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches\r\n",
        "of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful\r\n",

        "strong men besides the Cook.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the\r\n",

        "the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;\r\n",
        "a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold\r\n",

        "more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and\r\n",

        "colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted\r\n",
        "by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of\r\n",
        "treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with\r\n",

        "in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable\r\n",
        "to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and\r\n",
        "often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were\r\n",
        "charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no\r\n",
        "check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had\r\n",
        "sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,\r\n",
        "that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician\r\n",
        "custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a\r\n",
        "barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second\r\n",

        "With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of\r\n",

        "its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was\r\n",
        "nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness\r\n",
        "and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the\r\n",
        "people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they\r\n",
        "remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat\r\n",
        "and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes\r\n",
        "over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He took out his purse.\r\n",

        "craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The\r\n",
        "tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, \"Dead!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest\r\n",
        "made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder,\r\n",
        "sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were\r\n",
        "stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They\r\n",

        "His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical\r\n",
        "instrument.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"In effect, sir,\" pursued the nephew, \"I believe it to be at once your\r\n",
        "bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in\r\n",
        "France here.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I do not quite understand,\" returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.\r\n",
        "\"Dare I ask you to explain?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not\r\n",
        "been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would\r\n",
        "have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"It is possible,\" said the uncle, with great calmness. \"For the honour\r\n",
        "of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.\r\n",
        "Pray excuse me!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before\r\n",
        "yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,\" observed the nephew.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I would not say happily, my friend,\" returned the uncle, with refined\r\n",
        "politeness; \"I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for\r\n",
        "consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence\r\n",
        "your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for\r\n",
        "yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say,\r\n",
        "at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle\r\n",
        "aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that\r\n",
        "might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest\r\n",
        "and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted\r\n",
        "(comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such\r\n",
        "things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right\r\n",
        "of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such\r\n",
        "dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom),\r\n",
        "one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing\r\n",
        "some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? We have\r\n",
        "lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the\r\n",
        "assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as\r\n",
        "to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very\r\n",
        "bad!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;\r\n",
        "as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still\r\n",
        "containing himself, that great means of regeneration.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern\r\n",
        "time also,\" said the nephew, gloomily, \"that I believe our name to be\r\n",
        "more detested than any name in France.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Let us hope so,\" said the uncle. \"Detestation of the high is the\r\n",
        "involuntary homage of the low.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"There is not,\" pursued the nephew, in his former tone, \"a face I can\r\n",
        "look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any\r\n",
        "deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"A compliment,\" said the Marquis, \"to the grandeur of the family,\r\n",
        "merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.\r\n",
        "Hah!\" And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly\r\n",
        "crossed his legs.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes\r\n",
        "thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at\r\n",
        "him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,\r\n",
        "and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of\r\n",
        "indifference.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear\r\n",
        "and slavery, my friend,\" observed the Marquis, \"will keep the dogs\r\n",
        "obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,\" looking up to it, \"shuts\r\n",
        "out the sky.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the\r\n",
        "chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as\r\n",
        "they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to\r\n",
        "him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from\r\n",
        "the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof\r\n",
        "he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new\r\n",
        "way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead\r\n",
        "was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Meanwhile,\" said the Marquis, \"I will preserve the honour and repose\r\n",
        "of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we\r\n",
        "terminate our conference for the night?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"A moment more.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"An hour, if you please.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Sir,\" said the nephew, \"we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits\r\n",
        "of wrong.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"_We_ have done wrong?\" repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile,\r\n",
        "and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account\r\n",
        "to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father's time, we did\r\n",
        "a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and\r\n",
        "our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my father's time,\r\n",
        "when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father's twin-brother, joint\r\n",
        "inheritor, and next successor, from himself?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Death has done that!\" said the Marquis.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"And has left me,\" answered the nephew, \"bound to a system that is\r\n",
        "frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to\r\n",
        "execute the last request of my dear mother's lips, and obey the last\r\n",
        "look of my dear mother's eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to\r\n",
        "redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Seeking them from me, my nephew,\" said the Marquis, touching him on the\r\n",
        "breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--\"you\r\n",
        "will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was\r\n",
        "cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking\r\n",
        "quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he\r\n",
        "touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of\r\n",
        "a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the\r\n",
        "body, and said,\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have\r\n",
        "lived.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his\r\n",
        "box in his pocket.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Better to be a rational creature,\" he added then, after ringing a small\r\n",
        "bell on the table, \"and accept your natural destiny. But you are lost,\r\n",
        "Monsieur Charles, I see.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"This property and France are lost to me,\" said the nephew, sadly; \"I\r\n",
        "renounce them.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It\r\n",
        "is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed\r\n",
        "to me from you, to-morrow--\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"--or twenty years hence--\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"You do me too much honour,\" said the Marquis; \"still, I prefer that\r\n",
        "supposition.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to\r\n",
        "relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Hah!\" said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,\r\n",
        "under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,\r\n",
        "mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,\r\n",
        "and suffering.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Hah!\" said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better\r\n",
        "qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the\r\n",
        "weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave\r\n",
        "it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in\r\n",
        "another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse\r\n",
        "on it, and on all this land.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"And you?\" said the uncle. \"Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new\r\n",
        "philosophy, graciously intend to live?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at\r\n",
        "their backs, may have to do some day--work.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"In England, for example?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The\r\n",
        "family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be\r\n",
        "lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. The\r\n",
        "Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his\r\n",
        "valet.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have\r\n",
        "prospered there,\" he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew\r\n",
        "with a smile.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may\r\n",
        "be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You\r\n",
        "know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Yes.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"With a daughter?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Yes.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Yes,\" said the Marquis. \"You are fatigued. Good night!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy\r\n",
        "in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,\r\n",
        "which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same\r\n",
        "time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin\r\n",
        "straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that\r\n",
        "looked handsomely diabolic.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Yes,\" repeated the Marquis. \"A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So\r\n",
        "commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face\r\n",
        "outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew\r\n",
        "looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Good night!\" said the uncle. \"I look to the pleasure of seeing you\r\n",
        "again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his\r\n",
        "chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,\" he\r\n",
        "added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his\r\n",
        "valet to his own bedroom.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his\r\n",
        "loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still\r\n",
        "night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no\r\n",
        "noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some\r\n",
        "enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose\r\n",
        "periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just\r\n",
        "coming on.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the\r\n",
        "scraps of the day's journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow\r\n",
        "toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the\r\n",
        "prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at\r\n",
        "the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the\r\n",
        "chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,\r\n",
        "the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the\r\n",
        "tall man with his arms up, crying, \"Dead!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I am cool now,\" said Monsieur the Marquis, \"and may go to bed.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin\r\n",
        "gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence\r\n",
        "with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night\r\n",
        "for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables\r\n",
        "rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with\r\n",
        "very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to\r\n",
        "the owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures\r\n",
        "hardly ever to say what is set down for them.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,\r\n",
        "stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,\r\n",
        "dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.\r\n",
        "The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass\r\n",
        "were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might\r\n",
        "have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,\r\n",
        "taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as\r\n",
        "the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and\r\n",
        "the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and\r\n",
        "freed.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain\r\n",
        "at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the\r\n",
        "minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark\r\n",
        "hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light,\r\n",
        "and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still\r\n",
        "trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water\r\n",
        "of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces\r\n",
        "crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the\r\n",
        "weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur\r\n",
        "the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.\r\n",
        "At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open\r\n",
        "mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement\r\n",
        "windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth\r\n",
        "shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely\r\n",
        "lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to the\r\n",
        "fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men\r\n",
        "and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows\r\n",
        "out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church\r\n",
        "and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter\r\n",
        "prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its\r\n",
        "foot.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and\r\n",
        "surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been\r\n",
        "reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine;\r\n",
        "now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked\r\n",
        "round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at\r\n",
        "doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs\r\n",
        "pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the\r\n",
        "return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the\r\n",
        "chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried\r\n",
        "figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and\r\n",
        "everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already\r\n",
        "at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day's dinner (not\r\n",
        "much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while to\r\n",
        "peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it\r\n",
        "to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or\r\n",
        "no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life,\r\n",
        "down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the\r\n",
        "fountain.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about\r\n",
        "in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other\r\n",
        "emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought\r\n",
        "in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly\r\n",
        "on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their\r\n",
        "trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of\r\n",

        "Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood\r\n",
        "hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the\r\n",

        "\r\n",

        "painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You\r\n",
        "know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with\r\n",
        "the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you\r\n",
        "in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a\r\n",
        "little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon\r\n",

        "soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied\r\n",
        "with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is\r\n",
        "best spared. What do you say?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"How long would you keep me in town?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"Then I say yes,\" said Stryver: \"I won't go up there now, I am not so\r\n",

        "in to-night. Good morning.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a\r\n",
        "concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it\r\n",
        "bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength\r\n",
        "of the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were\r\n",
        "always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly\r\n",
        "believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in\r\n",
        "the empty office until they bowed another customer in.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have\r\n",
        "gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than\r\n",
        "moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to\r\n",
        "swallow, he got it down. \"And now,\" said Mr. Stryver, shaking his\r\n",
        "forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, \"my way\r\n",
        "out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found\r\n",
        "great relief. \"You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,\" said Mr.\r\n",

        "Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock,\r\n",
        "Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the\r\n",
        "purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of\r\n",
        "the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was\r\n",
        "altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Well!\" said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"And I have no doubt,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"that I was right in the\r\n",

        "advice.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I assure you,\" returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, \"that I\r\n",
        "am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father's\r\n",
        "account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let\r\n",
        "us say no more about it.\"\r\n",

        "not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is\r\n",
        "done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have\r\n",
        "repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish\r\n",
        "aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been\r\n",
        "a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am\r\n",
        "glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing\r\n",
        "for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could\r\n",
        "have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not\r\n",
        "proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means\r\n",
        "certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to\r\n",
        "that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and\r\n",
        "giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you\r\n",
        "will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,\r\n",
        "I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.\r\n",
        "And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,\r\n",

        "but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were\r\n",

        "unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing\r\n",
        "round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach\r\n",
        "there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were\r\n",
        "considered essential to the dignity of the position. The position\r\n",
        "appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble\r\n",
        "surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and\r\n",
        "incessantly groaning and calling out: \"Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!\"\r\n",
        "with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he\r\n",
        "always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed\r\n",
        "Tellson's. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance\r\n",
        "excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"What is it, brother? What's it about?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "greatest ardour, \"Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled\r\n",
        "against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the\r\n",
        "funeral of one Roger Cly.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Was He a spy?\" asked Mr. Cruncher.\r\n",

        "Spi--i--ies!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Why, to be sure!\" exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had\r\n",
        "assisted. \"I've seen him. Dead, is he?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Dead as mutton,\" returned the other, \"and can't be too dead. Have 'em\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,\r\n",
        "that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the\r\n",
        "suggestion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two vehicles\r\n",
        "so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd's opening the coach\r\n",
        "doors, the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands\r\n",
        "for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,\r\n",
        "that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after\r\n",
        "shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and\r\n",
        "other symbolical tears.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great\r\n",
        "enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a\r\n",
        "crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.\r\n",
        "They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin\r\n",
        "out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to\r\n",
        "its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being\r\n",
        "much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and\r\n",
        "the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,\r\n",
        "while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any\r\n",
        "exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers\r\n",
        "was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from\r\n",
        "the observation of Tellson's, in the further corner of the mourning\r\n",
        "coach.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in\r\n",
        "the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices\r\n",
        "remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory\r\n",
        "members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.\r\n",
        "The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the\r\n",
        "hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under\r\n",
        "close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended\r\n",
        "by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a\r\n",
        "popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional\r\n",
        "ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his\r\n",
        "bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to\r\n",
        "that part of the procession in which he walked.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite\r\n",
        "caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting\r\n",
        "at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination\r\n",
        "was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there\r\n",
        "in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,\r\n",
        "accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and\r\n",
        "highly to its own satisfaction.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of\r\n",
        "providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter\r\n",
        "genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual\r\n",
        "passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase\r\n",
        "was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near\r\n",
        "the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and\r\n",
        "they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of\r\n",
        "window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy\r\n",
        "and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had\r\n",
        "been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm\r\n",
        "the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were\r\n",
        "coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps\r\n",
        "the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual\r\n",
        "progress of a mob.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained\r\n",
        "behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.\r\n",
        "The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a\r\n",
        "neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and\r\n",
        "maturely considering the spot.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned\r\n",
        "himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his\r\n",
        "station at Tellson's. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched\r\n",
        "his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all\r\n",
        "amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent\r\n",

        "on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than\r\n",

        "person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an\r\n",

        "and not know that a mother's first duty is to blow her boy out?\"\r\n",

        "took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought\r\n",
        "forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other\r\n",
        "fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him\r\n",
        "in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,\r\n",
        "extinguished the light, and went out.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to\r\n",

        "followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the\r\n",
        "court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning\r\n",
        "his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the\r\n",
        "door stood ajar all night.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his\r\n",

        "walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his\r\n",
        "honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not\r\n",
        "gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and\r\n",
        "the two trudged on together.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the\r\n",
        "winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a\r\n",
        "lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,\r\n",
        "that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the\r\n",
        "second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split\r\n",
        "himself into two.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped\r\n",
        "under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low\r\n",
        "brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and\r\n",
        "wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which\r\n",
        "the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.\r\n",
        "Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that\r\n",
        "Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well\r\n",
        "defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.\r\n",
        "He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the\r\n",
        "third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay\r\n",
        "there a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands\r\n",
        "and knees.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It was now Young Jerry's turn to approach the gate: which he did,\r\n",
        "holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking\r\n",
        "in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!\r\n",
        "and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard\r\n",
        "that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church\r\n",
        "tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not\r\n",
        "creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to\r\n",
        "fish.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent\r\n",
        "appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.\r\n",
        "Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful\r\n",
        "striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off,\r\n",
        "with his hair as stiff as his father's.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not\r\n",
        "only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They\r\n",
        "were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for\r\n",
        "the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a\r\n",
        "screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were\r\n",
        "strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the\r\n",
        "earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what\r\n",
        "it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to\r\n",
        "wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he\r\n",
        "made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,\r\n",
        "it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable\r\n",
        "to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen\r\n",
        "was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt\r\n",
        "upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him\r\n",
        "and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to\r\n",
        "shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it\r\n",
        "was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the\r\n",
        "roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them\r\n",
        "like a dropsical boy's Kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways\r\n",
        "too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up\r\n",
        "to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,\r\n",
        "and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was\r\n",
        "incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy\r\n",
        "got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then\r\n",
        "it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every\r\n",
        "stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on\r\n",
        "his breast when he fell asleep.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after\r\n",
        "daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the\r\n",
        "family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry\r\n",
        "inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the\r\n",

        "yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street,\r\n",
        "sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the\r\n",
        "hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in\r\n",

        "that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man\r\n",
        "says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on\r\n",
        "the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies?\r\n",
        "I am not a scholar.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Listen once again then, Jacques!\" said the man with the restless hand\r\n",

        "all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and\r\n",
        "nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;\r\n",

        "\r\n",

        "\r\n",

        "of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her\r\n",
        "handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the\r\n",
        "night. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked\r\n",

        "by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than\r\n",
        "it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. He\r\n",

        "\"that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and\r\n",
        "coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it\r\n",
        "is always advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world\r\n",

        "it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Eh well! How then?\" demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there\r\n",

        "time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready.\"\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the\r\n",
        "wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she\r\n",
        "now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her\r\n",
        "usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not\r\n",
        "drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,\r\n",
        "and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous\r\n",
        "perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell\r\n",
        "dead at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies\r\n",
        "out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they\r\n",
        "themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met\r\n",

        "rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the\r\n",

        "It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be\r\n",
        "decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two\r\n",
        "men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,\r\n",
        "catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of\r\n",

        "Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there\r\n",
        "one left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open,\r\n",

        "unimpeachable.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "\"Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so.\r\n",
        "Of course.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"_I_ think?\" returned madame, in a high voice. \"I and my husband have\r\n",
        "enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we\r\n",
        "think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and\r\n",
        "it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without\r\n",

        "The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did\r\n",
        "not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,\r\n",
        "stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"My faith!\" returned madame, coolly and lightly, \"if people use knives\r\n",
        "for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the\r\n",
        "price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, \"Good day,\r\n",
        "Jacques!\" Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Good day, Jacques!\" the spy repeated; with not quite so much\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"No one has told me so,\" said Defarge, shaking his head. \"I know nothing\r\n",
        "of it.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his\r\n",
        "hand on the back of his wife's chair, looking over that barrier at the\r\n",
        "person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would\r\n",
        "have shot with the greatest satisfaction.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious\r\n",
        "attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh\r\n",
        "water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it\r\n",
        "out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over\r\n",
        "it.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?\"\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested\r\n",
        "in its miserable inhabitants.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"Indeed!\" said Defarge, with much indifference.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic,\r\n",
        "had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You see I am\r\n",
        "informed of the circumstances?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Such is the fact, certainly,\" said Defarge. He had had it conveyed\r\n",
        "to him, in an accidental touch of his wife's elbow as she knitted and\r\n",
        "warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"It was to you,\" said the spy, \"that his daughter came; and it was\r\n",
        "from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown\r\n",
        "monsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of\r\n",
        "Tellson and Company--over to England.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Such is the fact,\" repeated Defarge.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Very interesting remembrances!\" said the spy. \"I have known Doctor\r\n",
        "Manette and his daughter, in England.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Yes?\" said Defarge.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"You don't hear much about them now?\" said the spy.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"No,\" said Defarge.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"In effect,\" madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little\r\n",
        "song, \"we never hear about them. We received the news of their safe\r\n",
        "arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,\r\n",
        "they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held\r\n",
        "no correspondence.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Perfectly so, madame,\" replied the spy. \"She is going to be married.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Going?\" echoed madame. \"She was pretty enough to have been married long\r\n",
        "ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Oh! You know I am English.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I perceive your tongue is,\" returned madame; \"and what the tongue is, I\r\n",
        "suppose the man is.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best\r\n",
        "of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the\r\n",
        "end, he added:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to\r\n",
        "one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah,\r\n",
        "poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is\r\n",
        "going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard\r\n",
        "was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present\r\n",
        "Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is\r\n",
        "Mr. Charles Darnay. D'Aulnais is the name of his mother's family.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable\r\n",
        "effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter,\r\n",
        "as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was\r\n",
        "troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no\r\n",
        "spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be\r\n",
        "worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad\r\n",
        "paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say,\r\n",
        "in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the\r\n",
        "pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For some minutes\r\n",
        "after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the\r\n",
        "husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should\r\n",
        "come back.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Can it be true,\" said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife\r\n",
        "as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: \"what he has\r\n",
        "said of Ma'amselle Manette?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"As he has said it,\" returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, \"it\r\n",
        "is probably false. But it may be true.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"If it is--\" Defarge began, and stopped.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"If it is?\" repeated his wife.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her\r\n",
        "sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Her husband's destiny,\" said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure,\r\n",
        "\"will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is\r\n",
        "to end him. That is all I know.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"But it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strange\"--said\r\n",
        "Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it,\r\n",
        "\"that, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her\r\n",
        "husband's name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by\r\n",
        "the side of that infernal dog's who has just left us?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Stranger things than that will happen when it does come,\" answered\r\n",

        "She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently\r\n",
        "took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head.\r\n",
        "Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable\r\n",
        "decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its\r\n",
        "disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very\r\n",

        "In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned\r\n",
        "himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came\r\n",
        "to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame\r\n",
        "Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place\r\n",
        "to place and from group to group: a Missionary--there were many like\r\n",
        "her--such as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women\r\n",
        "knitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a\r\n",
        "mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the\r\n",
        "jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still,\r\n",
        "the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. And as Madame\r\n",
        "Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer\r\n",

        "light. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think\r\n",
        "of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against\r\n",
        "my prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic,\r\n",
        "that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I\r\n",
        "could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines\r\n",
        "with which I could intersect them.\" He added in his inward and pondering\r\n",
        "manner, as he looked at the moon, \"It was twenty either way, I remember,\r\n",
        "and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,\r\n",
        "deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in\r\n",

        "cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn\r\n",
        "child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it had\r\n",
        "been born alive, or the poor mother's shock had killed it. Whether it\r\n",
        "was a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my\r\n",
        "imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it\r\n",
        "was a son who would never know his father's story; who might even live\r\n",
        "to weigh the possibility of his father's having disappeared of his own\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of\r\n",
        "me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have\r\n",
        "cast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married\r\n",
        "to a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from\r\n",

        "like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its\r\n",
        "foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and\r\n",
        "leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her\r\n",
        "image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held\r\n",
        "her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door.\r\n",

        "sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was another\r\n",
        "and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than\r\n",
        "that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness too--as you\r\n",
        "have--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think?\r\n",

        "coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married\r\n",
        "life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture\r\n",
        "was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,\r\n",

        "a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked\r\n",
        "up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I\r\n",
        "imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things.\r\n",

        "change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,\r\n",
        "by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the\r\n",
        "apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only\r\n",
        "three at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that Charles\r\n",

        "she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his\r\n",
        "sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once\r\n",
        "more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves\r\n",
        "of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "The door of the Doctor's room opened, and he came out with Charles\r\n",

        "glanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the\r\n",
        "dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets. They returned home to\r\n",

        "manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own\r\n",
        "room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the\r\n",

        "I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back\r\n",
        "presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine\r\n",
        "there, and all will be well.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of\r\n",

        "old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus\r\n",
        "into the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.\r\n",

        "He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the\r\n",
        "throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a\r\n",
        "shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by\r\n",
        "him, and asked what it was.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the\r\n",
        "tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun\r\n",
        "into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark\r\n",
        "night.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had\r\n",
        "done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the\r\n",
        "Doctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench\r\n",
        "and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading\r\n",
        "at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which\r\n",
        "Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly\r\n",
        "studious and attentive.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt\r\n",
        "giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might\r\n",
        "not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his\r\n",
        "friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed\r\n",
        "as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of\r\n",
        "which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the\r\n",
        "answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real\r\n",
        "corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?\r\n",
        "How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor\r\n",
        "Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the\r\n",
        "Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning?\r\n",

        "had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have\r\n",
        "resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.\r\n",
        "He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular\r\n",
        "breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual\r\n",
        "had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.\r\n",
        "Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from\r\n",
        "the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked\r\n",
        "out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical\r\n",
        "toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual\r\n",
        "white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the\r\n",
        "usual way, and came to breakfast.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those\r\n",
        "delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe\r\n",
        "advance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken\r\n",
        "place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to\r\n",
        "the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and\r\n",
        "counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,\r\n",
        "he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the\r\n",

        "at his hands more than once.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,\r\n",
        "the--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a\r\n",
        "shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how\r\n",
        "long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there\r\n",

        "which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace\r\n",
        "himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is\r\n",

        "be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and\r\n",
        "great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his\r\n",
        "stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,\r\n",

        "\"That is the fact.\"\r\n",

        "the two spoke for a little while.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Now, my dear Manette,\" said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most\r\n",

        "was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most\r\n",
        "distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"I think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in\r\n",
        "singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in\r\n",
        "part, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy\r\n",
        "things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy\r\n",

        "chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top\r\n",
        "alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his\r\n",
        "chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to\r\n",

        "the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace\r\n",
        "flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a\r\n",
        "swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through\r\n",
        "the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the\r\n",
        "stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis\r\n",
        "had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four\r\n",
        "heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the\r\n",
        "branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four\r\n",
        "lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all\r\n",
        "was black again.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front,\r\n",
        "picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches,\r\n",
        "and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.\r\n",
        "Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the\r\n",
        "stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left\r\n",
        "there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was\r\n",
        "spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the\r\n",
        "space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur\r\n",
        "Gabelle's door. \"Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!\" The tocsin rang\r\n",
        "impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The\r\n",
        "mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood\r\n",
        "with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the\r\n",
        "sky. \"It must be forty feet high,\" said they, grimly; and never moved.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away\r\n",
        "through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on\r\n",
        "the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire;\r\n",
        "removed from them, a group of soldiers. \"Help, gentlemen--officers! The\r\n",
        "chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by\r\n",
        "timely aid! Help, help!\" The officers looked towards the soldiers who\r\n",
        "looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting\r\n",
        "of lips, \"It must burn.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the\r\n",
        "village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and\r\n",
        "fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of\r\n",
        "lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in\r\n",
        "every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,\r\n",
        "occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of\r\n",
        "Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on\r\n",
        "that functionary's part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to\r\n",
        "authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,\r\n",
        "and that post-horses would roast.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and\r\n",
        "raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the\r\n",

        "and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in\r\n",
        "torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the\r\n",
        "two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke\r\n",
        "again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake\r\n",
        "and contending with the fire.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,\r\n",
        "scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce\r\n",
        "figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten\r\n",
        "lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran\r\n",
        "dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the\r\n",
        "heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and\r\n",
        "splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied\r\n",
        "birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures\r\n",
        "trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded\r\n",
        "roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next\r\n",
        "destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and,\r\n",
        "abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and\r\n",
        "bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with\r\n",
        "the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment\r\n",
        "of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter\r\n",
        "days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his\r\n",
        "house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,\r\n",
        "Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel\r\n",
        "with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again\r\n",
        "withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time\r\n",
        "resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man\r\n",
        "of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the\r\n",
        "parapet, and crush a man or two below.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the\r\n",
        "distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door,\r\n",
        "combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an\r\n",
        "ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,\r\n",
        "which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.\r\n",
        "A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of\r\n",
        "the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur\r\n",
        "Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the\r\n",
        "rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed,\r\n",

        "that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged\r\n",
        "shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of\r\n",
        "being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger\r\n",

        "would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,\r\n",
        "circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn\r\n",
        "up together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in\r\n",
        "Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more\r\n",
        "into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and\r\n",
        "wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth\r\n",
        "that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by\r\n",
        "the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their\r\n",
        "way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.\r\n",

        "eyes over Gabelle's letter, the same personage in authority showed some\r\n",
        "disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went\r\n",
        "into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the\r\n",
        "gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles\r\n",
        "Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and\r\n",
        "patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress\r\n",
        "into the city for peasants' carts bringing in supplies, and for similar\r\n",
        "traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest\r\n",
        "people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not\r\n",
        "to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue\r\n",
        "forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they\r\n",
        "filtered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew\r\n",
        "their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the\r\n",
        "ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered\r\n",
        "about. The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men\r\n",
        "and women.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these\r\n",
        "things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,\r\n",
        "who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the\r\n",
        "escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him\r\n",
        "to dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse,\r\n",
        "turned and rode away without entering the city.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine\r\n",
        "and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake,\r\n",
        "drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and\r\n",
        "waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. The\r\n",
        "light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of\r\n",
        "the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly\r\n",
        "uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an\r\n",
        "officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Citizen Defarge,\" said he to Darnay's conductor, as he took a slip of\r\n",
        "paper to write on. \"Is this the emigrant Evremonde?\"\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were here.\" He\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response\r\n",

        "my right?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "\r\n",

        "truth?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"A bad truth for you,\" said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so\r\n",

        "and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope\r\n",
        "there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree.\r\n",
        "He, therefore, made haste to say:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better\r\n",

        "Mr. Lorry of Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris,\r\n",

        "I will do nothing for you.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride\r\n",
        "was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see\r\n",
        "how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the\r\n",
        "streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned\r\n",
        "their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat;\r\n",
        "otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no\r\n",
        "more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be\r\n",
        "going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they\r\n",
        "passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited\r\n",
        "audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal\r\n",
        "family. The few words that he caught from this man's lips, first made\r\n",
        "it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the\r\n",
        "foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at\r\n",
        "Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal\r\n",
        "watchfulness had completely isolated him.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had\r\n",
        "developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That\r\n",
        "perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster\r\n",
        "yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he\r\n",
        "might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events\r\n",
        "of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by\r\n",
        "the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future\r\n",
        "was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant\r\n",
        "hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few\r\n",
        "rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed\r\n",
        "garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had\r\n",
        "been a hundred thousand years away. The \"sharp female newly-born, and\r\n",
        "called La Guillotine,\" was hardly known to him, or to the generality\r\n",
        "of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were\r\n",
        "probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could\r\n",
        "they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation\r\n",
        "from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the\r\n",
        "certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on\r\n",
        "his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he\r\n",
        "arrived at the prison of La Force.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge\r\n",
        "presented \"The Emigrant Evremonde.\"\r\n",

        "responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, \"For\r\n",
        "the love of Liberty;\" which sounded in that place like an inappropriate\r\n",
        "conclusion.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a\r\n",
        "horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome\r\n",

        "\r\n",

        "until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with\r\n",
        "prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading\r\n",
        "and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the\r\n",

        "them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a\r\n",
        "solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Yours,\" said the gaoler.\r\n",

        "walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of\r\n",
        "the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler\r\n",
        "was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like\r\n",
        "a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was\r\n",
        "gone, he thought in the same wandering way, \"Now am I left, as if I were\r\n",
        "dead.\" Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it\r\n",
        "with a sick feeling, and thought, \"And here in these crawling creatures\r\n",

        "drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. \"He made shoes, he made\r\n",
        "shoes, he made shoes.\" The prisoner counted the measurement again, and\r\n",
        "paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition.\r\n",
        "\"The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was one among\r\n",
        "them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the\r\n",
        "embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden\r\n",
        "hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God's sake,\r\n",
        "through the illuminated villages with the people all awake! * * * * He\r\n",
        "made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and\r\n",
        "a half.\" With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of\r\n",
        "his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting\r\n",
        "and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it\r\n",

        "that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did\r\n",
        "his duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade,\r\n",
        "was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages\r\n",
        "of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two\r\n",
        "great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the\r\n",
        "open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared\r\n",
        "to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy,\r\n",
        "or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless\r\n",
        "objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had\r\n",
        "opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and\r\n",
        "he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.\r\n",

        "the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring\r\n",
        "in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible\r\n",

        "Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought,\r\n",
        "\"They have come back!\" and sat listening. But, there was no loud\r\n",
        "irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate\r\n",
        "clash again, and all was quiet.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to\r\n",
        "go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly\r\n",
        "opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in\r\n",

        "collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to\r\n",
        "us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the\r\n",
        "bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices\r\n",
        "came pouring into the courtyard.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and\r\n",
        "said, with a cool, bold smile:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been\r\n",
        "a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris? In\r\n",
        "France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would\r\n",
        "touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.\r\n",
        "My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the\r\n",
        "barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I\r\n",
        "knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I\r\n",
        "told Lucie so.--What is that noise?\" His hand was again upon the window.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Don't look!\" cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. \"No, Lucie, my\r\n",
        "dear, nor you!\" He got his arm round her, and held her. \"Don't be so\r\n",
        "terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm\r\n",
        "having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in\r\n",

        "do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or\r\n",
        "I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night;\r\n",
        "you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you\r\n",
        "to do for Charles's sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must\r\n",
        "instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a\r\n",
        "room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for\r\n",
        "two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not\r\n",

        "Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near\r\n",
        "enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all. The\r\n",
        "people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they\r\n",

        "\r\n",

        "men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of\r\n",
        "the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than\r\n",
        "the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.\r\n",
        "False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their\r\n",

        "howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of\r\n",

        "forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women\r\n",

        "struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and\r\n",
        "fire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from\r\n",
        "the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the\r\n",
        "sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all\r\n",
        "over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain\r\n",
        "upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women's lace\r\n",
        "and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through\r\n",
        "and through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be\r\n",
        "sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to\r\n",
        "the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments\r\n",
        "of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And\r\n",
        "as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream\r\n",
        "of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in\r\n",

        "confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water,\r\n",
        "carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.\r\n",
        "For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and\r\n",
        "the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him,\r\n",
        "surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all\r\n",
        "linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with\r\n",

        "watching them in such quiet as the night knew.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet,\r\n",
        "clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.\r\n",
        "Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to\r\n",
        "imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under\r\n",
        "the Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded\r\n",
        "for Lucie and her child, without a moment's demur; but the great trust\r\n",
        "he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict\r\n",
        "man of business.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out\r\n",
        "the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to\r\n",
        "the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the\r\n",
        "same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the\r\n",
        "most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in\r\n",
        "its dangerous workings.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute's delay\r\n",
        "tending to compromise Tellson's, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said\r\n",
        "that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that\r\n",
        "Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to\r\n",
        "this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and\r\n",
        "he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry\r\n",
        "went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up\r\n",
        "in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows\r\n",
        "of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross:\r\n",
        "giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself.\r\n",
        "He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear\r\n",
        "considerable knocking on the head, and retained to his own occupations.\r\n",
        "A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly\r\n",
        "and heavily the day lagged on with him.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. He\r\n",
        "was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to\r\n",
        "do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a\r\n",
        "man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,\r\n",
        "addressed him by his name.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Your servant,\" said Mr. Lorry. \"Do you know me?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five\r\n",
        "to fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of\r\n",
        "emphasis, the words:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Do you know me?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I have seen you somewhere.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Perhaps at my wine-shop?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: \"You come from Doctor\r\n",
        "Manette?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Yes. I come from Doctor Manette.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"And what says he? What does he send me?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the\r\n",
        "words in the Doctor's writing:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "    \"Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.\r\n",
        "     I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note\r\n",
        "     from Charles to his wife.  Let the bearer see his wife.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It was dated from La Force, within an hour.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Will you accompany me,\" said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading\r\n",
        "this note aloud, \"to where his wife resides?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Yes,\" returned Defarge.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical\r\n",
        "way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the\r\n",
        "courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Madame Defarge, surely!\" said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly\r\n",
        "the same attitude some seventeen years ago.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"It is she,\" observed her husband.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Does Madame go with us?\" inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as\r\n",
        "they moved.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Yes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons.\r\n",
        "It is for their safety.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Beginning to be struck by Defarge's manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously\r\n",
        "at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being\r\n",
        "The Vengeance.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,\r\n",
        "ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry,\r\n",
        "and found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the\r\n",
        "tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that\r\n",
        "delivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in\r\n",
        "the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "     \"DEAREST,--Take courage.  I am well, and your father has\r\n",
        "      influence around me.  You cannot answer this.\r\n",
        "      Kiss our child for me.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who received\r\n",
        "it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the\r\n",
        "hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly\r\n",
        "action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took\r\n",
        "to its knitting again.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in\r\n",
        "the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her\r\n",
        "neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted\r\n",
        "eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"My dear,\" said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; \"there are frequent\r\n",
        "risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever\r\n",
        "trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power\r\n",
        "to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she\r\n",
        "may identify them. I believe,\" said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his\r\n",
        "reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself\r\n",
        "upon him more and more, \"I state the case, Citizen Defarge?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a\r\n",
        "gruff sound of acquiescence.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"You had better, Lucie,\" said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to\r\n",
        "propitiate, by tone and manner, \"have the dear child here, and our\r\n",
        "good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no\r\n",
        "French.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a\r\n",
        "match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger,\r\n",
        "appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance,\r\n",
        "whom her eyes first encountered, \"Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope\r\n",
        "_you_ are pretty well!\" She also bestowed a British cough on Madame\r\n",
        "Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Is that his child?\" said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the\r\n",
        "first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it\r\n",
        "were the finger of Fate.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Yes, madame,\" answered Mr. Lorry; \"this is our poor prisoner's darling\r\n",
        "daughter, and only child.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so\r\n",
        "threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively\r\n",
        "kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The\r\n",
        "shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall,\r\n",
        "threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"It is enough, my husband,\" said Madame Defarge. \"I have seen them. We\r\n",
        "may go.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and\r\n",
        "presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as\r\n",
        "she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"You will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will\r\n",
        "help me to see him if you can?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Your husband is not my business here,\" returned Madame Defarge, looking\r\n",
        "down at her with perfect composure. \"It is the daughter of your father\r\n",
        "who is my business here.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She\r\n",
        "will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more\r\n",
        "afraid of you than of these others.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.\r\n",
        "Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her,\r\n",
        "collected his face into a sterner expression.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"What is it that your husband says in that little letter?\" asked Madame\r\n",
        "Defarge, with a lowering smile. \"Influence; he says something touching\r\n",
        "influence?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"That my father,\" said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her\r\n",
        "breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, \"has\r\n",
        "much influence around him.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Surely it will release him!\" said Madame Defarge. \"Let it do so.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"As a wife and mother,\" cried Lucie, most earnestly, \"I implore you to\r\n",
        "have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against\r\n",
        "my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think\r\n",
        "of me. As a wife and mother!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,\r\n",
        "turning to her friend The Vengeance:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little\r\n",
        "as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have\r\n",
        "known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them,\r\n",
        "often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in\r\n",
        "themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,\r\n",
        "sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"We have seen nothing else,\" returned The Vengeance.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"We have borne this a long time,\" said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes\r\n",
        "again upon Lucie. \"Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife\r\n",
        "and mother would be much to us now?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge\r\n",
        "went last, and closed the door.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Courage, my dear Lucie,\" said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. \"Courage,\r\n",
        "courage! So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of\r\n",
        "late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a\r\n",
        "shadow on me and on all my hopes.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Tut, tut!\" said Mr. Lorry; \"what is this despondency in the brave\r\n",
        "little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself,\r\n",
        "for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his\r\n",
        "absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be\r\n",
        "kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that\r\n",
        "not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she\r\n",
        "know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all\r\n",
        "ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been\r\n",
        "darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been\r\n",
        "tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon\r\n",
        "the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that\r\n",
        "some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on\r\n",
        "which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a\r\n",
        "scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he had\r\n",
        "found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were\r\n",
        "brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth\r\n",
        "to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back\r\n",
        "to their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he\r\n",
        "had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen\r\n",
        "years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the\r\n",
        "body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this\r\n",
        "man was Defarge.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table,\r\n",
        "that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard\r\n",
        "to the Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some\r\n",
        "dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life\r\n",
        "and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as\r\n",
        "a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded\r\n",
        "to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and\r\n",
        "examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when\r\n",
        "the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible\r\n",
        "to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That,\r\n",
        "the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that\r\n",
        "the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held\r\n",
        "inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner\r\n",
        "was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the\r\n",
        "Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and\r\n",
        "assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,\r\n",
        "delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had\r\n",
        "often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and\r\n",
        "had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by\r\n",
        "intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were\r\n",
        "saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against\r\n",
        "those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had\r\n",
        "been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had\r\n",
        "thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress\r\n",
        "the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him\r\n",
        "in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies\r\n",
        "of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this\r\n",
        "awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man\r\n",
        "with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him\r\n",
        "carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged\r\n",
        "anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes\r\n",
        "with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of\r\n",
        "his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that\r\n",
        "such dread experiences would revive the old danger.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never\r\n",
        "at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor\r\n",
        "felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time\r\n",
        "he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which\r\n",
        "could break the prison door of his daughter's husband, and deliver him.\r\n",
        "\"It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.\r\n",
        "As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be\r\n",
        "helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid\r\n",
        "of Heaven I will do it!\" Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw\r\n",
        "the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing\r\n",
        "of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a\r\n",
        "clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which\r\n",
        "had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would\r\n",
        "have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself\r\n",
        "in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees\r\n",
        "of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his\r\n",
        "personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician\r\n",
        "of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie\r\n",
        "that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the\r\n",
        "general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet\r\n",
        "messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself\r\n",
        "sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor's hand), but she was\r\n",
        "not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of\r\n",
        "plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were\r\n",
        "known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a\r\n",
        "word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule\r\n",
        "through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did\r\n",
        "so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus\r\n",
        "of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French\r\n",
        "language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and\r\n",
        "pursuits.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. If\r\n",
        "you really don't want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you\r\n",
        "do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"I said so!\" cried her brother, interrupting. \"I knew it. You want to be\r\n",

        "as I am getting on!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any\r\n",
        "culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years\r\n",
        "ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent\r\n",
        "her money and left her!\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case,\r\n",
        "all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder,\r\n",
        "hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"I say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon,\r\n",

        "previously uttered a word.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Come!\" said Mr. Cruncher. \"Speak out, you know.\" (Which, by the way,\r\n",
        "was more than he could do himself.) \"John Solomon, or Solomon John? She\r\n",
        "calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And _I_ know\r\n",
        "you're John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that\r\n",
        "name of Pross, likewise. That warn't your name over the water.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"What do you mean?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"No?\"\r\n",

        "\"Indeed?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Yes. T'other one's was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness\r\n",

        "\"That's the name for a thousand pound!\" cried Jerry.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind\r\n",

        "an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember\r\n",

        "a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with\r\n",
        "the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your\r\n",
        "direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and\r\n",
        "sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved\r\n",
        "conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the\r\n",
        "nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"What purpose?\" the spy asked.\r\n",

        "\r\n",

        "quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind,\r\n",
        "and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and\r\n",
        "made the most of it.\r\n",

        "remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney's arm and looked up\r\n",
        "in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced\r\n",
        "purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only\r\n",
        "contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. She was\r\n",
        "too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved\r\n",

        "little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the\r\n",
        "picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked\r\n",
        "into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years\r\n",
        "ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, \"What do you\r\n",

        "over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the\r\n",
        "messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no\r\n",
        "earthly doubt that he is retaken.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Mr. Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss\r\n",
        "of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something\r\n",
        "might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was\r\n",
        "silently attentive.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I\r\n",
        "will play the losing one. No man's life here is worth purchase. Any one\r\n",

        "stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend\r\n",

        "brute I am; I wish you'd give me a little brandy.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another\r\n",
        "glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Mr. Barsad,\" he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking\r\n",

        "committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,\r\n",
        "so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman\r\n",
        "is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a\r\n",
        "Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name.\r\n",
        "That's a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican\r\n",
        "French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic\r\n",
        "English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That's an excellent\r\n",
        "card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.\r\n",
        "Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the\r\n",
        "spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom,\r\n",
        "the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so\r\n",
        "difficult to find. That's a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my\r\n",
        "hand, Mr. Barsad?\"\r\n",

        "Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don't\r\n",
        "hurry.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and\r\n",
        "drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself\r\n",
        "into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he\r\n",
        "poured out and drank another glassful.\r\n",

        "\"Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing\r\n",
        "there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for\r\n",
        "vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern\r\n",
        "date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in\r\n",
        "France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen\r\n",
        "there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He\r\n",
        "knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint\r\n",
        "Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop; had received from the watchful police\r\n",
        "such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's imprisonment,\r\n",
        "release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to\r\n",
        "familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame\r\n",
        "Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered\r\n",
        "with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he\r\n",
        "talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.\r\n",
        "He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over\r\n",
        "again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the\r\n",
        "guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as\r\n",
        "he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that\r\n",
        "he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of\r\n",
        "his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning\r\n",
        "terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such\r\n",
        "grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw\r\n",
        "that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many\r\n",
        "proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash\r\n",
        "his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon\r\n",
        "terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"You scarcely seem to like your hand,\" said Sydney, with the greatest\r\n",

        "wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little\r\n",
        "flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat\r\n",
        "and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their\r\n",
        "light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair,\r\n",
        "all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was\r\n",
        "sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;\r\n",

        "wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having\r\n",

        "Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw\r\n",
        "closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and\r\n",
        "nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and\r\n",
        "preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances\r\n",
        "that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!),\r\n",
        "and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"I understand the feeling!\" exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. \"And\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"Yes,\" said Carton. \"I am not old, but my young way was never the way to\r\n",

        "Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A\r\n",
        "few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. Carton left him\r\n",
        "there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate\r\n",
        "again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to\r\n",
        "the prison every day. \"She came out here,\" he said, looking about him,\r\n",

        "\"Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words\r\n",
        "aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of\r\n",
        "negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who\r\n",
        "had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into\r\n",
        "his road and saw its end.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that\r\n",

        "soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should\r\n",
        "have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded over the\r\n",

        "carry the lists of his day's duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton\r\n",
        "took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. \"We should look\r\n",

        "with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class,\r\n",
        "opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of\r\n",

        "his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was\r\n",
        "insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and\r\n",

        "been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which\r\n",
        "she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had\r\n",
        "been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any\r\n",

        "worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her\r\n",
        "dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her\r\n",
        "bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened\r\n",
        "dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such\r\n",

        "waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,\r\n",
        "the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry's\r\n",
        "attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,\r\n",
        "but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining\r\n",
        "it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their\r\n",
        "escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.\r\n",
        "Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross\r\n",
        "and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at\r\n",
        "three o'clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.\r\n",
        "Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,\r\n",

        "of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that\r\n",
        "pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had\r\n",
        "beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had\r\n",
        "passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding\r\n",
        "their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,\r\n",
        "taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the\r\n",

        "\"Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,\" said Miss Pross, whose agitation\r\n",

        "suspicion.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,\" said\r\n",

        "\"Respectin' a future spear o' life, miss,\" returned Mr. Cruncher, \"I\r\n",
        "hope so. Respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o'\r\n",
        "mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o'\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"First,\" said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with\r\n",
        "an ashy and solemn visage, \"them poor things well out o' this, never no\r\n",
        "more will I do it, never no more!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,\" returned Miss Pross, \"that you\r\n",
        "never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it\r\n",
        "necessary to mention more particularly what it is.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"No, miss,\" returned Jerry, \"it shall not be named to you. Second: them\r\n",
        "poor things well out o' this, and never no more will I interfere with\r\n",
        "Mrs. Cruncher's flopping, never no more!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,\" said Miss Pross,\r\n",
        "striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, \"I have no doubt it\r\n",

        "superintendence.--O my poor darlings!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I go so far as to say, miss, moreover,\" proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a\r\n",
        "most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--\"and let my words\r\n",
        "be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my\r\n",
        "opinions respectin' flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only\r\n",
        "hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man,\" cried the distracted\r\n",
        "Miss Pross, \"and I hope she finds it answering her expectations.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Forbid it,\" proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity,\r\n",
        "additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold\r\n",

        "flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get 'em out o' this here dismal\r\n",
        "risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-_bid_ it!\" This was Mr. Cruncher's\r\n",
        "conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came\r\n",
        "nearer and nearer.\r\n",

        "you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"If you were to go before,\" said Miss Pross, \"and stop the vehicle and\r\n",

        "that be best?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but\r\n",
        "Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame\r\n",
        "Defarge was drawing very near indeed.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"By the cathedral door,\" said Miss Pross. \"Would it be much out of\r\n",

        "towers?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"No, miss,\" answered Mr. Cruncher.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"Heaven knows we don't,\" returned Miss Pross, \"but have no fear for me.\r\n",
        "Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o'Clock, or as near it as you can,\r\n",
        "and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain\r\n",
        "of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives\r\n",
        "that may depend on both of us!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty\r\n",
        "clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he\r\n",
        "immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself\r\n",
        "to follow as she had proposed.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The having originated a precaution which was already in course of\r\n",

        "her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the\r\n",
        "streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty\r\n",
        "minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted\r\n",
        "rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door\r\n",
        "in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,\r\n",
        "which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she\r\n",
        "could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the\r\n",
        "dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there\r\n",
        "was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried\r\n",
        "out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of\r\n",
        "Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood,\r\n",
        "those feet had come to meet that water.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, \"The wife of Evremonde;\r\n",
        "where is she?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It flashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing open,\r\n",
        "and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were\r\n",
        "four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before\r\n",
        "the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement,\r\n",
        "and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful\r\n",
        "about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness,\r\n",
        "of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different\r\n",
        "way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,\" said Miss\r\n",
        "Pross, in her breathing. \"Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of\r\n",
        "me. I am an Englishwoman.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of\r\n",
        "Miss Pross's own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight,\r\n",
        "hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a\r\n",
        "woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that\r\n",
        "Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well\r\n",
        "that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"On my way yonder,\" said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of\r\n",
        "her hand towards the fatal spot, \"where they reserve my chair and my\r\n",
        "knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other's words;\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this\r\n",
        "moment,\" said Madame Defarge. \"Good patriots will know what that means.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,\" returned Miss Pross, \"and I\r\n",

        "you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in\r\n",

        "at naught.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Woman imbecile and pig-like!\" said Madame Defarge, frowning. \"I take no\r\n",
        "answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand\r\n",
        "to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!\"\r\n",
        "This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I little thought,\" said Miss Pross, \"that I should ever want to\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Neither of them for a single moment released the other's eyes. Madame\r\n",
        "Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross\r\n",
        "first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.\r\n",
